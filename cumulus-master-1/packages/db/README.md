# @cumulus/db

Utilities for working with the Cumulus database.

## Versioning

Cumulus uses a modified semantic versioning scheme and minor releases likely
include breaking changes.

Before upgrade, please read the Cumulus
[release notes](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/releases) before upgraded.

It is strongly recommended you do not use `^` in your `package.json` to
automatically update to new minor versions. Instead, pin the version or use `~`
to automatically update to new patch versions.

## Installation

```bash
  npm install @cumulus/db
```
