# üî® Development

The Cumulus core repo is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)
managed by [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). Lerna is responsible for installing
the dependencies of the packages and tasks that belong in this repo. In general,
Cumulus's npm packages can be found in the [packages](./packages) directory, and
workflow tasks can be found in the [tasks](./tasks) directory.

To help cut down on the time and disk space required to install the dependencies
of the packages in this monorepo, all `devDependencies` are defined in the
top-level [package.json](./package.json). The
[Node module resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders)
allows all of the packages and tasks to find their dev dependencies in that
top-level `node_modules` directory.

TL;DR - If you need to add a `devDependency` to a package, add it to the
top-level [package.json](./package.json) file, not the `package.json` associated
with an individual package.

## Installation

This is for installation for Cumulus development.  See the [Cumulus deployment instructions](https://nasa.github.io/cumulus/docs/deployment/deployment-readme) for instructions on deploying the released Cumulus packages.

### Prerequisites

- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and node version 12.18
- [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
- BASH
- Docker (only required for testing)
- docker-compose (only required for testing `pip install docker-compose`)
- Python 3.6+

Install the correct node version:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

### Install Lerna

We use Lerna to manage multiple Cumulus packages in the same repo. You need to install lerna as a global module first:

    $ npm install -g lerna

### Install Local Dependencies

We use npm for local package management

    $ npm install
    $ npm run bootstrap

Building All packages:

    $ npm run build

Build and watch packages:

    $ npm run watch

## Running the Cumulus APIs locally

Start the API:

    $ npm run serve

Or start the distribution API:

    $ npm run serve-dist

See the [API package documentation](packages/api/README.md#running-the-api-locally) for more options.

## üìù Tests

### Unit Tests

#### LocalStack

[LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) provides local versions of most AWS services for testing.

The LocalStack repository has [installation instructions](https://github.com/localstack/localstack#installing).

Localstack is included in the docker-compose file. You only need to run the docker-compose command in the next section in order to use it with your tests.

#### Docker containers

Turn on the docker containers first:

    $ npm run start-unit-test-stack

Stop localstack/unit test services:

    $ npm run stop-unit-test-stack

#### Run database migrations

```
$ npm run db:local:migrate
```

#### Run tests

Run the test commands next
```
    $ export LOCAL_ES_HOST=127.0.0.1
    $ export LOCALSTACK_HOST=127.0.0.1
    $ npm test
```

### Integration Tests

For more information please [read this](docs/development/integration-tests.md).

### Running tests via VS Code debugger

Copy the `.vscode.example` directory to `.vscode` to create your debugger launch configuration. Refer to the [VS Code documentation on how to use the debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

## üî¶ Code Coverage and Quality

For more information please [read this](docs/development/quality-and-coverage.md).

## üì¶ Adding New Packages

Create a new folder under `packages` if it is a common library or create folder under `cumulus/tasks` if it is a lambda task. `cd` to the folder and run `npm init`.

Make sure to name the package as `@cumulus/package-name`.

## Running command in all package folders

    $ lerna exec -- rm -rf ./package-lock.json

## Cleaning Up all the repos

    $ npm run clean
